# React Todo Application

Welcome to the React Todo Application! This project aims to provide a simple and intuitive todo list manager built using React. Our goal is to create a seamless user experience for managing tasks, whether it's a personal to-do list, a project tracker, or a collaborative task manager.

## Challenges

Creating a robust and user-friendly todo application comes with its own set of challenges. Here are some of the challenges we've tackled:

1. **State Management**: Managing the application state efficiently to reflect task changes, categories, and completion status across components.
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application looks and works great on different screen sizes and orientations.
3. **User Experience**: Designing an interface that is easy to use and understand, allowing users to interact with their tasks without any confusion.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it ideal for creating interactive applications.
- CSS (with CSS Modules or Styled Components): Styling the application to provide an appealing and responsive user interface.
